# Analysis of Mental Health in the Tech Industry

## Overview
This project tackles the critical issue of mental health in the tech industry, applying a comprehensive data analysis approach. By utilizing SQL for data manipulation, statistical methods for inference, and visualization tools for insights, we aim to understand the prevalence, attitudes, and awareness of mental health issues among tech workers.

## Objectives
- To perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends related to mental health in the tech industry.
- To apply statistical techniques to test hypotheses about mental health in tech.
- To visualize the findings to convey the current state of mental health awareness, support, and challenges within the tech industry.

## Dataset
The analysis is based on the Mental Health in the Tech Industry Dataset, which includes responses from tech workers on various aspects of mental health at work. [Download the data here](https://www.kaggle.com/anth7310/mental-health-in-the-tech-industry).

## Key Insights
- Gender differences in discussing mental health issues with peers and supervisors.
- Age-related perceptions of mental health discussions' repercussions.
- The prevalence of mental health issues by region, with notable statistics for the US, UK, and Canada.
- Company size and its correlation with the provision of mental health resources.

## Conclusions
The study highlights the need for improved mental health resources in the tech industry, especially in smaller companies. It also suggests a disparity between tech and non-tech sectors in mental health support. Open discussions with supervisors, rather than coworkers, are preferred, indicating the importance of managerial support for mental health.

## Future Research
Further investigation is required to explore gender and age-related nuances in mental health discussions, the impact of remote work on mental well-being, and the effectiveness of anonymity in encouraging help-seeking behavior.
